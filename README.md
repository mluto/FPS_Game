# FPS Game

FPS Game is my super test task.

## Usage

How to play?<br/>
WSAD or arrow buttons to move.<br/>
LMP - fire<br/>
PPM - switch weapon<br/>
<br/>
The color of the weapon indicates what color objects we can destroy.<br/>
The right color depends on mixing the primary colors<br/>
Green: blue and yellow objects<br/>
Orange: red and yellow objects<br/>
Purple: red and blue objects<br/>
